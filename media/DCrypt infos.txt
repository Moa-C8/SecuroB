 
To use correctly D&Crypt you need to: 

- use a key or a password 
    |- > (to create a key go on Folder in menu bar)
    |-- > (the key is unique don't loose it)
    |-- > (also don't forget you're password)
            and press return the entry doesn't auto
            refresh
            
- Then you can import a file 
    |- > (Work with all type of file)             
- Now you can Crypt or Decrypt thanks to the buttons 

- You also can modify .txt in the textbox and save it
    the button save will appear if you browse txt file
